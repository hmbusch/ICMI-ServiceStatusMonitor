Abstract
--------
The Service status monitor is a small applicance that signals the 
health of monitored IT systems (or whatever else you might want to
monitor) with indicators mimicking traffic lights.

Basic operation
---------------
Several services are monitored by a custom application on a computer 
somewhere. This software communicates with an Arduino board via 
serial link and tells the Arduino what to display on the health 
monitor. The health monitor itself consists of one or more segments, 
each capable of mimicking a traffic light, i.e. displaying green, 
yellow or red. For those with color blindness, the colors use can 
simply be changed.

The health display itself will consist of several “traffic light” 
segments. For simply monitoring the availability of a service, 
a single segment is enough. In my case, in addition to knowing 
that the database is up and running, I also would like some 
indicator that reflects the current load on the system. For this 
purpose, I should be able to assign more than one segment to 
this services, resulting in a finer resolution of the service 
status.
